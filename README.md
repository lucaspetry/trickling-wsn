## Deliverables
1. [Project plan.](https://github.com/lucaspetry/trickling-wsn/blob/master/report/d1_project_plan.md)
2. [Report on restrictions and limitations of embedded systems and the strategy used to tackle the problems.](https://github.com/lucaspetry/trickling-wsn/blob/master/report/d2_restrictions_project_design_report.md)
3. Code and test results of the prediction algorithms on a general purpose operating system.
4. Code and test results of the basic statistics predictor on [EPOS](http://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/EPOS+2+User+Guide).
5. Code and test results of the neural network predictor on [EPOS](http://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/EPOS+2+User+Guide).
6. Deployed algorithm on [UFSC IoT Gateway](http://iot.ufsc.br/HomePage).
7. Project demonstration.
